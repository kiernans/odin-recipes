        <li>
            Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add meat, flour, onion, and garlic; cook and stir until browned, 10 to 15 minutes.        </li>
        <li>
            Add broth, tomatoes, potatoes, celery, and carrots, then stir in Creole seasoning and basil. Bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to maintain simmer and cook, uncovered, until potatoes are soft, meat is tender, and gravy is thick, about 1 hour.
